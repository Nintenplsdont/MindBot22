# MindBot22

Unofficial implementation of the card game "The Mind" (2018). The goal is to play all distributed cards in the correct order without communication. 
Featuring: queues, live games in embeds, power cards, timing reset requests, and basic score tracking.

My personal first larger python project, and the first time I coded with the goal of making the code "nice".
